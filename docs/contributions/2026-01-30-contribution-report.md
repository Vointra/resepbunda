## Methodology Notes

**Data Sources**:
- Git commit history analyzed via `git log` (58 total commits from 9 developers)
- WBS task completion from `docs/product_documents/WBS.csv` (73 tasks tracked)
- WhatsApp activity from `whatsapp-group-chat-activity.csv` (292 messages analyzed)
- Subjective assessments based on code quality, leadership, and teamwork observed across all channels

**Scoring Weights**:
- Git Commits: 30%
- WBS Tasks: 30%
- WhatsApp Activity: 15%
- Subjective Factors: 25%

**Git Score Calculation**:
- Commit count: 40 points (normalized to highest committer)
- Commit quality: 30 points (meaningful messages avg)
- Code impact: 30 points (estimated from commit types and complexity)

**WBS Score Calculation**:
- Tasks completed: 50 points (normalized to highest completer)
- Task priority weight: 30 points (P0=3pts, P1=2pts, P2=1pt)
- Task complexity: 20 points (based on estimated hours)

**WhatsApp Score Calculation**:
- Message count: 30 points (normalized to most active)
- Helpful responses: 40 points (based on quality indicators)
- Discussion participation: 30 points

**Subjective Score Calculation**:
- Average of 6 qualitative factors (1-5 scale each):
  - Leadership qualities
  - Code quality and consistency
  - Helpfulness to teammates
  - Initiative and proactivity
  - Communication skills
  - Problem-solving ability
- Converted to 100-point scale (multiply by 20)

**Assumptions**:
- Merge commits counted toward committer's total but weighted less in quality assessment
- "Needs RC" and "Request Change" WBS statuses counted as incomplete
- WhatsApp helpfulness assessed based on problem-solving, support, and knowledge sharing
- PM/QA (Lutfi) and Code Reviewer (R. Purba) roles weighted appropriately in subjective assessment
- Dyo Aristo's AFK status and module reassignment factored into all category scores
- All developers assumed to have equal access and opportunity to contribute

**Limitations**:
- Subjective assessments based on observable behaviors, may not capture all contributions
- WhatsApp analysis based on message content, may miss private communications
- Git commits may not reflect all work (some delivered via PR without direct commit)
- WBS completion based on status markers, actual quality verified through code reviews
- Assessment period limited to available data (2024-12-19 to 2026-01-30)
